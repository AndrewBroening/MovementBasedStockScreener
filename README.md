# MovementBasedStockScreener
This is a streamlit program that scans the stock market one by one for stocks that follow a certain movement. This is useful for finding stocks that work well with specific strategies.

This program requires a csv file of all of the tickers in the stock market. Some tickers may not work if they arent supported by alpha vantage which could cause unnecessary computation time.
